DEBUGGING GUIDE
---------------


To initiate a leak search in MallocDebug, do the following:

Launch MallocDebug.
Open a new window and select the executable you want to examine.
Click the Launch button.
Exercise the application features to build its memory profile.
In MallocDebug, select “Leaks” from the analysis popup menu to display the memory leaks in your application.
Use the call-graph data in the browser to find where the memory was allocated.



In executable info you can set debbugging environment variables




put these in main

#import <Foundation/NSDebug.h>

	NSDebugEnabled = YES;
	NSZombieEnabled = YES;
	NSDeallocateZombies = NO;
//	NSHangOnMallocError = NO;	// This one seems broken!  The app crashes if its set!
	NSHangOnUncaughtException = YES;


freed objects are made into zombies so that you can still send messages to them


you can then use 	BOOL isFreed = NSIsFreedObject (thing);
