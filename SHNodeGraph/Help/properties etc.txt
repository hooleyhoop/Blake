	the words 'nodeGroups' and 'scripts' are used interchangeably
	
	
	SHInputProperty & SHOutputProperty
	----------------------------------

	all SHInputProperties and SHOutputProperties are Nodes. Add them to scripts and then they
	are visible as inputs and outputs when the scripts are nested
	
	
	all operators extend 'script', but have a flag so that when opened cant be edited on a low level
		( maybe you see somesort of 'blackbox' with properties connected )
	
	all SHInputProperty
	all input and output properties have an <ID>value
	all input and output properties have the appropriate inlet or outlet
	
	soâ only SHNodeGroups, and therefore 'Operators' have SHInputProperties and SHOutputProperties - they can be wired together
