To make applescript support work we need to hack the sdef file and make each 
extension of NSApplication inherit from some other extension of NSApplication.
For instance BlocksPreferencesSuite's application inherits from 
BlocksConfigurationSuite's application. Would be nice if we didn't have to do
this.
