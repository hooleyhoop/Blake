maya has transform nodes which act like layers and groups

traznsfor can have 'shape-node' children

shape-node children can have geeometry-node children


every piece of geometry must have at least 2 nodes above it -  a shap and then a transfrom

transform can have any number of child transforms

it only really makes sense for a transform to have 1 shape

1 shape can have - !many parent transforms! -- these are instances! the shape will be drawn each time for each parent transform!
